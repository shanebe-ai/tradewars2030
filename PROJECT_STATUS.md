### 13. Bug Fixes Applied
- ✅ **Fixed: Player sector assignment bug** - Players were being assigned `sectors.id` (database primary key) instead of `sector_number`. This caused players to appear in "sector 1151" when they should be in sector 1.
- ✅ **Fixed: Universe minimum ports** - Enforced minimum 5% ports and at least 1 port for small universes. Sol (sector 1) excluded from ports for safe starting zone.
- ✅ **Fixed: Warp count bug** - Warps were being doubled (A→B and B→A). Now stored once with bidirectional lookup.
- ✅ **Fixed: Earth planet display** - Added automatic Earth planet creation in Sector 1 during universe generation.
- ✅ **Fixed: Terra Corp ownership** - Earth displays "Owner: Terra Corp" as unclaimable NPC planet.

- **Planet Generation** ✅
  - ~3% of sectors receive claimable planets during universe generation
  - Random planet names (e.g., "Alpha Prime", "Nexus Outpost", "Vega Colony")
  - Planets exclude Sector 1 (Earth) and port sectors
  - All generated planets are claimable by players
- **Turn Regeneration System** ✅
  - Turns regenerate gradually based on time elapsed since last update
  - Formula: `turns_per_hour = turns_per_day / 24`
  - Regeneration happens automatically when player data is fetched
  - Capped at universe's `turns_per_day` setting (default 1000)
  - `last_turn_update` timestamp tracks regeneration

## Current Session Context 🎯

**What We Just Did:**
- ✅ **Implemented Warp Drive Misfire System:**
  - Server-side misfire logic in sectorController.ts
  - 0.25% chance of malfunction (configurable MISFIRE_CHANCE constant)
  - Random sector selection on misfire (excludes current sector)
  - Response includes misfired flag and misfireMessage
  - Game event logging includes misfire details
- ✅ **Enhanced Misfire Alert UI:**
  - Separate misfireAlert state for prominent display
  - Bold pink/red pulsing alert box with neon glow
  - Screen shake animation for 3 seconds on misfire
  - Alert persists until player warps again (pulsing continues)
- ✅ **Navigation History Improvements:**
  - Visited sectors have darker green border (rgba(0, 100, 0, 0.9))
  - Previous sector marked with ◄ indicator
  - localStorage persistence for visited sectors tracking

**Warp Misfire Implementation:**
- Server: `MISFIRE_CHANCE = 0.0025` (0.25%)
- On misfire: selects random sector from universe, logs event with intended vs actual destination
- Client: displays `⚠ WARP DRIVE MALFUNCTION!` alert with shake effect
- CSS animations: shake (3s) and pulse (infinite while alert visible)

**Servers Currently Running:**
- Backend: http://localhost:3000 (npm run dev in /home/helloai/server)
- Client: http://localhost:5175 (npm run dev in /home/helloai/client)
- Admin: http://localhost:5174 (npm run dev in /home/helloai/admin)

**Ready For:**
- Ship communications system
- Aliens with alien planets and ships
- Combat system implementation
- Planet colonization (claiming, colonists, production)

**Phase 5: Planet Combat**
12. **Attack Planet** - Fight through sector fighters → bombard planet
13. **Citadel Combat** - Damage citadel, fight colonist militia
14. **Capture vs Destroy** - Take ownership or destroy enemy planet
15. **Deploy Fighters** - Station fighters in sector to protect planet

- Large ecosystem

### Why Socket.io?
- Real-time bidirectional communication

## Game Mechanics Reference

### Port Types
- **BBS** (Fuel=Buy, Org=Buy, Equip=Sell) - Equipment production
- **BSB** (Fuel=Buy, Org=Sell, Equip=Buy) - Organics production
- **SBB** (Fuel=Sell, Org=Buy, Equip=Buy) - Fuel production
- **SSB, SBS, BSS** - Various configurations
- **SSS** - Sells all (rare, lucrative for traders)
- **BBB** - Buys all (rare, good for dumping cargo)

### Ship Progression
1. **Escape Pod** (5 holds) - Emergency only
2. **Scout** (20 holds) - Starting ship
3. **Trader** (60 holds) - Early upgrade
4. **Freighter** (125 holds) - Mid-game
5. **Merchant Cruiser** (250 holds) - Advanced
6. **Corporate Flagship** (500 holds) - Ultimate trader

### Default Universe Configuration
- 1000 sectors default
- ~10-15% have ports
- ~3% have claimable planets (~30 planets)
- Bidirectional warp connections
- Sol sector (Earth) - starting location, Terra Corp owned
- AI aliens as NPCs

### Planet Mechanics (TW2002-inspired)
**Production Types:**
- **Fuel** - Produces fuel ore (best fuel output)
- **Organics** - Produces organics (best org output)
- **Equipment** - Produces equipment (best equip output)
- **Balanced** - Produces all three (lower efficiency)

**Colonist System:**
- Buy colonists at ports (special commodity)
- Transport in cargo holds to your planet
- More colonists = higher production rate
- Population grows over time (daily tick)
- Colonists also serve as planetary militia (defense)

**Citadel Levels:**
- Level 0: No citadel (colonists only defense)
- Level 1-2: Basic defenses
- Level 3: Atmospheric defense (harder to bombard)
- Level 4: Transporter (beam cargo without landing)
- Level 5: Interdictor generator (enemies can't warp out)

**Planet Strategy:**
1. Find remote sector (fewer visitors = safer)
2. Claim planet, set production type
3. Transport colonists (thousands for good production)
4. Build citadel for defense
5. Regularly collect produced resources
6. Sell at ports for profit

## Development Environment

### Ports
- **Client (Game)**: `http://localhost:5173` - Player game interface
- **Admin Panel**: `http://localhost:5174` - Universe/game management (admin only)
- **Backend API**: `http://localhost:3000` - REST API + WebSocket server

### Database
- PostgreSQL on `localhost:5432`
- Database name: `tradewars`

## Design Philosophy

### ASCII Art as Graphics
Unlike the original text-only TradeWars 2002, this modern version uses ASCII art as **visual graphics elements**:
- Ships rendered as ASCII sprites (not just names)
- Ports shown with distinctive ASCII art indicators
- Sector views with visual ASCII map representations
- Combat animations using ASCII art
- Planet colonies displayed with ASCII graphics

Source material from original TradeWars 2002 ASCII art will be adapted and enhanced with cyberpunk neon styling.

### Cyberpunk Aesthetic
- **Neon Green**: Friendly systems, go signals, positive status
- **Neon Cyan**: Navigation, information, neutral data
- **Neon Magenta/Pink**: Alerts, danger, warnings, combat
- **Neon Purple**: Special items, rare events, admin functions
- **Black background**: Terminal-style with optional CRT effects
