**CONFIDENTIAL BRIEFING - TERRACORP INDEPENDENT TRADERS GUILD**
*Authorization Level: New Recruit*
*Document Version: 3.7.2030*

---

## The Year is 2030

The megacorporations won. Not through war—through economics. When TerraCorp consolidated the Solar Banking System in 2024, they didn't just control money. They controlled *movement*. Every jump through space, every credit transferred, every breath of recycled air in the stations—TerraCorp takes their cut.

But where there's power, there's profit. And where there's profit, there are **traders**.

You're one of them now. An independent contractor with a barely-functional Scout-class ship and enough credits to maybe survive the week. Out here in the void, beyond TerraSpace's safe corporate umbrella, fortunes are made and lost in a single cargo run. Pirates prowl the shipping lanes. Alien species—once thought extinct—have returned with ships that shimmer like oil on water and intentions no one understands.

This isn't a simulation. Your ship computer just pinged—**you've entered the game**.

---

## 📡 Your Ship Computer

### The Interface

Your entire existence runs through one terminal. Green phosphor glow, cascading data streams, and a constant hum of cooling fans that keeps the quantum processors from melting. This is your **Ship Computer**—part navigator, part accountant, part therapist when the loneliness hits.

**Your Command Center:**
- **Sector Scanner** - Where you are, who else is here, what you can do
- **Navigation Matrix** - Warp points to other sectors
- **Cargo Manifest** - What you're hauling (and what it's worth)
- **Ship Status** - Hull integrity, fighter count, shield capacity
- **Communications Array** - Messages, broadcasts, intel
- **Ship's Log** - Your discoveries, your notes, your legacy

### The Live Universe

This isn't some turn-based email game from the '90s. Your ship computer maintains an **active quantum-entangled link** to every other ship in your universe. When something happens, *everyone knows*.

Watch in real-time as:
- Ships warp into your sector with an alert ping
- Combat broadcasts flash across the TNN network
- Planets get claimed across the galaxy
- Genesis torpedoes create new worlds
- Alien comms chatter with hostile encounters
- Your deployed mines obliterate an unsuspecting raider

**The void is watching. Always.**

---

## 🚀 Your First Flight

### TerraSpace: The Safe Zone

You start in **Sector 1 - Sol System**. Home. Earth. Terra. Whatever you want to call the blue marble that birthed humanity and then sold it to the highest bidder.

**TerraSpace** is TerraCorp's protected bubble—a safe zone that scales with your universe. These are the *safe lanes* where aggressive aliens can't follow, enforced by automated defense satellites that'll turn hostile ships to slag.

Here's what you'll find:
- **Sol (Sector 1)**: Earth. Terra Corp's crown jewel. You don't own it.
- **Exit Sectors**: Your gateway to the wild frontier
- **Mars**: Terra Corp's frontier colony at the edge of safety
- **StarDocks**: Where you buy ships, upgrade gear, and access banking

Trade aliens might pass through—they're generally friendly. But the real credits are made **beyond TerraSpace**. Out where the law is whatever you make it.

### Time is Turns

In the void, time isn't measured in hours—it's measured in **turns**. And turns are the most valuable resource in the universe.

You get a fresh supply every day, regenerating slowly while you sleep. Moving costs a turn. Trading costs a turn. Attacking someone costs a turn. Every decision matters.

Waste your turns exploring dead-ends, and you'll watch richer pilots dock their Merchant Cruisers while you're still scraping by.

### Navigation: The Warp Drive

Your ship's warp drive lets you jump between sectors through **warp points**. Think of space as a web—each sector connects to a handful of others nearby. No straight lines. No predictability. Just a tangled mesh of possibilities.

**Modern warp technology is constrained by local space-time**—you can only jump to sectors within range. This means:
- Getting across the universe requires multiple hops through the web
- Some sectors become natural chokepoints and trade hubs
- Distance feels *real*—the galaxy is vast
- Trade routes emerge organically as pilots find profitable paths

**⚠️ WARP DRIVE MALFUNCTION WARNING:**
Your Scout's warp drive is cheap. Like *really* cheap. Sometimes it misfires and sends you to a random sector instead of your destination. The screen shakes, alarms blare, and you arrive somewhere you didn't plan to be. It's not a bug—it's a feature of buying second-hand military surplus.

---

## 💰 The Economics of Survival

### Port Trading: Your Bread & Butter

**Ports** are automated trading stations scattered across the galaxy. No human crew, just algorithms that buy and sell commodities based on local demand. TerraCorp licenses them. You exploit them.

**Three Commodities:**
- **Fuel Ore** (orange) - Ships run on it. Stations burn it.
- **Organics** (green) - Food, medicine, biological materials.
- **Equipment** (blue) - Tech, weapons, ship parts.

**The Port Code:**

Each port has a 3-letter signature that tells you what they do:
- **B** = Buying (they'll pay you top dollar)
- **S** = Selling (they're giving it away cheap)

Format: **[Fuel][Organics][Equipment]**

**The Money Makers:**
- **SBB** ports sell fuel cheap
- **BSS** ports buy fuel expensive
- Load up at SBB, sell at BSS, get rich

**The Unicorns:**
- **SSS** ports sell *everything* cheap (jackpot!)
- **BBB** ports buy *everything* expensive (your payday!)

**Your First Trade Run:**

Find an SBB port. Fill your cargo holds with cheap fuel. Jump to a BSS port. Sell it for triple the price. Repeat until you can afford something better than a Scout.

Twenty cargo holds × triple markup = enough profit to start building an empire.

### Colonists: The Secret Investment

Some ports sell **colonists**—living, breathing people looking for a new home. They're expensive, but they're not cargo. They're *future workers* for your future empire.

Buy them. Store them. When you claim a planet, you'll need thousands to make it profitable. Smart pilots start stockpiling early.

---

## 🏴‍☠️ Combat & Survival

### The Rules of Engagement

Out beyond TerraSpace, there are no rules. If another pilot wants your cargo, they'll take it. If you want their ship, you'll take *that*.

**Combat is quick and brutal:**
- You initiate. Your fighters attack. Their shields break. They die.
- Or their shields hold. Your fighters die. You respawn in an Escape Pod somewhere random.

**Winner takes most of the loser's wealth.** Loser respawns naked in an Escape Pod with nothing but regrets.

**Death hurts:**
- You lose your ship, your cargo, your fighters, your dreams
- A chunk of your credits vanishes—even from your bank account
- You respawn in the void with a 5-hold Escape Pod

**Combat Strategy 101:**
- Don't fight unless you have the firepower
- Shields protect your fighters—always buy shields
- If you're hauling valuable cargo, avoid sectors with other ships
- The Corporate Flagship is a flying fortress—nearly unstoppable

### Defensive Warfare

**Deploy fighters in sectors** to guard your territory. Anyone entering has to fight through them or retreat. But deployed fighters cost daily maintenance—if you can't pay, they're auto-destroyed.

**Mines** are the galaxy's favorite trap. Drop them in sectors and wait. When enemies warp in, the mines explode with devastating force. **Your corporation is immune**—only outsiders trigger them.

**Beacons** let you send a message to every ship that enters a sector:
- *"This sector belongs to NovaCorp. Leave now."*
- *"50 mines deployed. Your funeral."*
- *"You just lost the game."*

Enemies can destroy your beacons, but they'll lose fighters trying.

---

## 🌍 Planetary Empire

### Finding & Claiming Planets

Hidden throughout the galaxy are **unclaimed planets**—virgin worlds waiting for someone bold enough to claim them. They're not on any map. You find them by exploring.

When you stumble into a sector with a planet, your ship computer lights up with opportunity. **Claim it.** It's free. It's yours forever (until someone destroys it).

### Building Your Colony

**Phase 1: Bring Colonists**

Buy colonists at ports. Fly them to your planet. Drop them off. They live there now.

**Phase 2: Choose Production**

Tell your colonists what to make:
- **Fuel Production** - They mine fuel ore from the planet's crust
- **Organics Production** - They farm, harvest, process biological materials
- **Equipment Production** - They manufacture tech and weapons
- **Balanced** - A bit of everything (safe but inefficient)

**Phase 3: Build Defenses**

Construct a **Citadel** to defend your planet from raiders. Higher-level citadels not only repel attacks but also boost production efficiency. The strongest citadels are nearly impregnable.

**Phase 4: Profit**

Visit your planet. Withdraw resources. Sell them at ports. Watch the credits roll in.

A well-developed planet with thousands of colonists can generate more passive income than you'll make trading manually.

### Genesis Torpedoes: Play God

Can't find a planet? **Make one.**

Buy Genesis Torpedoes at StarDock for a small fortune. Launch one in any empty sector. Watch as a new planet materializes from the void. The entire universe gets notified of your creation.

**Strategic uses:**
- Create planets in remote sectors where pirates won't find them
- Build trade hubs between profitable port clusters
- Establish territory for your corporation

Every pilot in the galaxy will see the TNN broadcast when you create a world. Make it count.

---

## 🏦 Banking & Finance

### The StarDock Banking System

TerraCorp's **banking system** lets you store credits somewhat safely. Safer than carrying cash, anyway.

**How it works:**
- **Personal vault** - Your private account
- **Corporate vault** - Shared with your corporation
- Deposits are free
- Withdrawals cost a small fee (TerraCorp always gets their cut)
- Transfers to other pilots are free

**Death still hurts your bank balance**, but not as much as losing everything in your cargo hold.

**Why use banking?**
- Keep your fortune safe from pirates
- Fund corporate operations through shared accounts
- Transfer credits to allies

**Why NOT use banking?**
- Withdrawal fees add up
- You still lose a chunk on death
- If you're confident you won't die, carry credits on-hand for better margins

### Corporate Banking Hierarchy

In a corporation, not everyone gets full access to the vault:
- **Founders** control everything
- **Officers** can withdraw limited amounts
- **Members** can deposit but barely withdraw

Trust your officers. Or don't. The choice shapes your empire.

---

## 🛸 The Alien Question

### They Came Back

In 2028, long-range scanners picked up energy signatures that didn't match any known technology. At first, TerraCorp dismissed them as sensor ghosts. Then a supply convoy disappeared near the Outer Rim. Then another. Then an entire mining colony went dark.

They're not ghosts. They're **aliens**—species that humanity thought were myths or extinct. And they're back.

### The Alien Races

Ten distinct species roam the void, each with their own ships and apparent motives:

**Known Species:**
- **Xenthi** - Crystalline bio-ships, mostly neutral traders
- **Vorlak** - Aggressive warships, attack on sight
- **Krynn** - Defensive, guard their territory fiercely
- **Sslith** - Patrol routes, avoid confrontation
- **Zendarr**, **Thorax**, **Quell**, **Nebari**, **Vedran**, **Pyrians** - Still under observation

### Encounters in the Void

After years of observation, xeno-intelligence has learned that most aliens aren't monsters—they're *civilizations* with traders, guards, and military forces just like humanity.

**The majority are merchants and peacekeepers.** They won't attack unless provoked.

**A dangerous minority are raiders.** They attack human ships on sight.

**The strategic choice is yours:** That Xenthi trader hauling equipment? You could blast them for easy loot. But is it worth making enemies of an entire species? Or do you escort them, hoping they'll remember your ship when you need safe passage through hostile space?

### The Alien Communications Network

When you first visit a sector with an **alien planet**, your ship computer intercepts something—encrypted transmissions on frequencies humanity doesn't use. Your AI cracks the code.

**You can't send messages** (they wouldn't listen anyway), but you can **monitor their network** for intel:
- Track alien ship movements
- Learn patrol patterns
- Avoid ambushes
- Find weakened targets

Knowledge is survival.

---

## 🏢 Corporations & Alliances

### The Corporation System

You started alone. One pilot, one ship, one personal corporation. That's... sad.

**You can do better:**
- Leave your personal corp and join another
- Create a new corporation and invite others
- Build an empire through numbers

**Corporation Benefits:**
- **Private chat channel** for coordination
- **Shared banking** for pooled resources
- **Territory immunity** - your mines won't hurt corpmates
- **Reputation** - strength in numbers scares off pirates

### The Hierarchy

Every corporation has ranks:
- **Founders** run the show
- **Officers** help manage operations
- **Members** contribute to the empire

The rank structure determines who can invite, kick, promote, and access the corporate vault.

**Corporate Strategy:**
- Recruit traders to pool resources
- Recruit fighters to control territory
- Share banking for emergency funds
- Coordinate attacks on high-value targets

Alone, you're prey. Together, you're a force.

---

## 🗺️ Advanced Pilot Tools

### Plot Course: Navigation Done Right

Your ship computer has a **pathfinding algorithm** that'll calculate the shortest route to any sector. It auto-navigates, saves you time, and smartly pauses at points of interest so you don't fly past ports or planets.

Pilots who manually jump sector-by-sector waste time. Smart pilots use Plot Course and focus on strategy.

### Ship's Log: Your Memory

The galaxy is vast. You can't remember where everything is. Your **Ship's Log** does it for you.

Your computer automatically logs:
- **Ports** with their trading types
- **StarDocks** for ship upgrades
- **Planets** you discover
- **Dead ends** to avoid

You can also add manual notes to flag good trade routes, dangerous sectors, or that planet you claimed three jumps from nowhere.

**Filter by type** to quickly find what you need. Your Ship's Log is your map of the galaxy.

### Deep Sector Scan

Don't want to waste a turn moving into an unknown sector? **Scan it first.**

For the cost of one turn, you get complete intel without moving:
- Who's in the sector (ships, fighters, defenses)
- What's there (ports, planets, StarDocks)
- Hazards (mines, hostile forces)

**When to use it:**
- Scouting before combat
- Checking if your trade route is clear
- Avoiding ambushes
- Finding empty sectors to hide in

---

## 🎯 Ship Progression: From Scraps to Flagship

### The Fleet

You start in a **Scout**—barely a ship, more like a coffin with an engine. It's slow, fragile, and worth less than the fuel in its tanks.

But every pilot starts somewhere.

**Your progression:**
1. **Scout** → **Trader** - Triple your cargo capacity, start making real money
2. **Trader** → **Freighter** - Massive holds, serious trade runs
3. **Freighter** → **Merchant Cruiser** - Balanced combat and cargo
4. **Merchant Cruiser** → **Corporate Flagship** - The endgame ship. Flying fortress.

### The Trade-In System

When you buy a new ship, you don't lose your old one—you trade it in for a discount. Your fighters, shields, and cargo transfer automatically (up to new ship limits).

**Example:**
- You own a Trader
- Trade-in value covers most of the Freighter cost
- Net price is much cheaper than buying from scratch
- Your fighters and cargo move to the new ship

Smart pilots upgrade gradually, using trade-ins to minimize costs.

### The Progression Path

**Early Game:** Grind trade runs. Fill your Scout, sell, repeat. Upgrade to Trader as soon as possible.

**Mid Game:** Claim a planet. Set up production. Let passive income supplement your trading.

**Late Game:** Merchant Cruiser or Flagship. Multiple planets. Corporate banking. Territory control.

**Endgame:** You don't trade anymore. Your empire generates income while you fight, explore, or build political power.

---

## 💎 The Economics of Getting Rich

### Commodity Trading Basics

Ports buy high, sell low (from their perspective). You do the opposite.

**Find an SBB port** (sells fuel cheap) → **Load up on fuel** → **Jump to BSS port** (buys fuel expensive) → **Sell** → **Profit**

Scale this with larger ships and you'll print money.

### The Rare Ports

**SSS ports sell everything cheap.** When you find one, fill your entire ship. Every hold. Max capacity.

**BBB ports buy everything expensive.** When you find one, sell everything. Take the payday.

These rare ports are goldmines. Mark them in your Ship's Log.

### StarDock Equipment

Beyond ships, StarDocks sell:
- **Fighters** - Offense in combat
- **Shields** - Defense in combat
- **Mines** - Territory traps
- **Beacons** - Communication markers
- **Genesis Torpedoes** - Planet creation

Each has strategic value depending on your playstyle.

### Combat as Income

Pirates don't just steal cargo—they *are* a business model. A successful attack nets you most of the victim's wealth.

**Risk vs reward:**
- Attacking traders is profitable but makes enemies
- Attacking fighters is dangerous but removes threats
- Attacking weak targets is safe but yields less loot

Some pilots build empires through trade. Others build them through conquest.

## ⚠️ Survival Guide

### Things That Will Kill You

1. **Warp Misfires** - Random, rare, unavoidable. Pray it doesn't send you into a minefield.
2. **Pirates** - Other players who want your cargo. Stay alert.
3. **Aggressive Aliens** - They attack on sight. Monitor Alien Comms.
4. **Deployed Fighters** - You get a warning. Choose retreat or die.
5. **Mines** - If you see "⚠️ MINES DETECTED", retreat immediately.
6. **Overconfidence** - Even a Corporate Flagship can fall to coordinated attacks.

### Things That Will Save You

1. **TerraSpace** - The safe zone. Retreat here when wounded.
2. **Ship's Log** - Know your safe routes.
3. **Banking** - Protect your wealth from total loss.
4. **Corporation** - Allies are insurance. Numbers = survival.
5. **Plot Course** - Don't wander aimlessly into danger.
6. **Alien Comms** - Intel saves lives.

### The Unwritten Rules

- **Don't camp Sol** - Newbie hunting is pathetic
- **Honor ransoms** - If someone pays, let them go
- **Respect territory** - If a sector is claimed, think twice before mining it
- **TNN is public** - Don't whine about deaths in broadcasts

The void has no laws, but it has *culture*. Violate it at your own risk.

## 🌌 The Endgame

### What Victory Looks Like

There's no "win condition" in TradeWars 2030. No final boss. No credits threshold that ends the game. Just you, your ship, and the infinite void.

**But here's what the best pilots achieve:**

**Economic Dominance:**
- Corporate Flagship with maxed fighters and shields
- Multiple planets producing resources 24/7
- Millions in credits across personal and corporate banks
- Control of rare ports through deployed defenses

**Military Supremacy:**
- Feared reputation that makes pilots flee on sight
- Control of strategic sectors with layered defenses
- Successful raids on alien planets
- A kill count that makes veterans nervous

**Exploration Mastery:**
- The entire galaxy mapped in your Ship's Log
- Every alien planet discovered and cataloged
- Deep-space routes that bypass main shipping lanes
- Knowledge that makes you invaluable to corporations

**Political Power:**
- A massive corporation with dozens of members
- Alliance networks spanning multiple corps
- Economic influence that shapes the universe
- Diplomatic immunity through sheer power

### The Final Transmission

TerraCorp will never acknowledge your success. There are no medals for space traders. No awards ceremonies in the void.

But every pilot knows the legends. The names whispered in Corporate Chat. The beacons that warn of empires built on guts and credits.

**You started with a Scout and a dream.**

**Now go build something that scares the megacorps.**
