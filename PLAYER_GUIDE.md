**CONFIDENTIAL BRIEFING - TERRACORP INDEPENDENT TRADERS GUILD**
*Authorization Level: New Recruit*
*Document Version: 3.7.2030*

---

## The Year is 2030

The megacorporations won. Not through war—through economics. When TerraCorp consolidated the Solar Banking System in 2024, they didn't just control money. They controlled *movement*. Every jump through space, every credit transferred, every breath of recycled air in the stations—TerraCorp takes their cut.

But where there's power, there's profit. And where there's profit, there are **traders**.

You're one of them now. An independent contractor with a barely-functional Scout-class ship and enough credits to maybe survive the week. Out here in the void, beyond TerraSpace's safe corporate umbrella, fortunes are made and lost in a single cargo run. Pirates prowl the shipping lanes. Alien species—once thought extinct—have returned with ships that shimmer like oil on water and intentions no one understands.

This isn't a simulation. Your ship computer just pinged—**you've entered the game**.

---

## 📡 Part I: Your Ship Computer

### The Interface

Your entire existence runs through one terminal. Green phosphor glow, cascading data streams, and a constant hum of cooling fans that keeps the quantum processors from melting. This is your **Ship Computer**—part navigator, part accountant, part therapist when the loneliness hits.

**Key Systems:**
- **Sector Scanner** - Where you are, who else is here, what you can do
- **Navigation Matrix** - Warp points to other sectors
- **Cargo Manifest** - What you're hauling (and what it's worth)
- **Ship Status** - Hull integrity, fighter count, shield capacity
- **Communications Array** - Messages, broadcasts, intel
- **Ship's Log** - Your discoveries, your notes, your legacy

---

## 🚀 Part II: Your First Flight

### TerraSpace: The Safe Zone

You start in **Sector 1 - Sol System**. Home. Earth. Terra. Whatever you want to call the blue marble that birthed humanity and then sold it to the highest bidder.

**TerraSpace** is sectors 1-10. These are the *safe lanes*—combat is illegal here, enforced by automated defense satellites that'll turn your ship to slag faster than you can scream. TerraCorp maintains this bubble of civilization:
- **Sector 1 (Sol)**: Earth. Terra Corp owns it. You don't.
- **Sector 5**: StarDock Alpha-1. Buy ships, upgrade gear, access banking.
- **Sectors 2-10**: Charted territory. No surprises. Also no fortunes.

The real credits are made **beyond TerraSpace**. Out where the law is whatever you make it.

### Your First Run: Understanding the Turn Economy

Time is money. No—*time is turns*, and turns are the most valuable resource in the universe.

**Turn Basics:**
- You get **300 turns per day** (that's ~12.5 turns per hour)
- Moving between sectors costs **1 turn**
- Trading costs **1 turn per transaction**
- Attacking someone costs **1 turn**
- Turns regenerate automatically—but they're never enough

Every decision matters. Waste your turns exploring dead-ends, and you'll watch richer pilots laugh as they dock their Merchant Cruisers.

### Navigation 101: The Warp Drive

Your ship's warp drive lets you jump between sectors through **warp points**. Think of space as a web—each sector connects to 2-6 others. No straight lines. No predictability. Just a tangled mesh of possibilities.

**How to Move:**
1. Scan your current sector (free, no turn cost)
2. Review available warp points
3. Pick a destination
4. **Hit WARP** - Costs 1 turn

**⚠️ WARP DRIVE MALFUNCTION WARNING:**
Your Scout's warp drive is cheap. Like *really* cheap. There's a 0.25% chance it misfires and sends you to a **random sector** instead of your destination. You'll know when it happens—the screen shakes, alarms blare, and you arrive somewhere you didn't plan to be. It's not a bug. It's feature of buying second-hand military surplus.

---

## 💰 Part III: The Economics of Survival

### Port Trading: Your Bread & Butter

**Ports** are automated trading stations. No human crew, just algorithms that buy and sell commodities based on local demand. TerraCorp licenses them. You exploit them.

**Three Commodities:**
- **Fuel Ore** (orange icons) - Ships run on it. Stations burn it.
- **Organics** (green icons) - Food, medicine, biological materials.
- **Equipment** (blue icons) - Tech, weapons, ship parts.

**Port Types** (this is critical—memorize it):

Each port has a 3-letter code: **[Fuel][Organics][Equipment]**
- **B** = Buying (they buy from you at HIGH prices)
- **S** = Selling (they sell to you at LOW prices)

| Port Type | Fuel | Organics | Equipment | Strategy |
|-----------|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **BBS** | Buy | Buy | Sell | Buy equipment here, sell at SBB/BSB |
| **SBB** | Sell | Buy | Buy | Buy fuel here, sell at BBS/BSS |
| **BSB** | Buy | Sell | Buy | Buy organics here, sell at SBB/BSS |
| **SSS** | Sell | Sell | Sell | **RARE** - Load up on everything |
| **BBB** | Buy | Buy | Buy | **RARE** - Dump all cargo for max profit |

**Basic Trade Route:**
1. Find an **SBB** port (sells fuel cheap)
2. Load up on fuel (₡10/unit)
3. Jump to a **BSS** port (buys fuel expensive)
4. Sell fuel (₡34/unit)
5. **Profit: ₡24/unit** × your cargo capacity

Rinse. Repeat. Get rich. Buy bigger ship. Repeat with more cargo.

**Example Starting Run (Scout ship - 20 cargo holds):**
- Buy 20 fuel at SBB: -₡200
- Sell 20 fuel at BSS: +₡680
- **Net profit: ₡480** (minus 2 turns for trading + travel)

Do this 20 times and you've earned ₡9,600—halfway to your first ship upgrade.

### Colonists: The Secret Commodity

Some ports sell **colonists** (₡100 each). They're not cargo—they're *future workers* for your future empire. Buy them. Store them. When you claim a planet, you'll need thousands of colonists to make it profitable.

---

## 🏴‍☠️ Part IV: Combat & Survival

### The Rules of Engagement

Out beyond TerraSpace, there are no rules. If another pilot wants your cargo, they'll take it. If you want their ship, you'll take *that*.

**Combat Basics:**
- **Costs 1 turn** to initiate attack
- **Fighters deal damage** - Each fighter you have attacks
- **Shields absorb damage** - Shields protect your fighters
- **Winner takes 75%** of loser's credits + cargo
- **Loser respawns in Escape Pod** at a random nearby sector

**Death Penalty:**
- Lose **25% of your credits** (on-hand + bank balance)
- Lose **all fighters, shields, cargo, colonists**
- Respawn in Escape Pod with 5 cargo holds and zero weapons

**Combat Strategy:**
- Don't fight unless you **outnumber** your opponent 2:1
- Always have shields—they absorb damage before fighters
- If you're carrying valuable cargo, **avoid populated sectors**
- Corporate Flagship (₡500K) has 300 fighters + 1000 shields = nearly invincible

### Defensive Tactics

**Deployed Fighters:**
Station fighters in a sector (max 500) to guard territory. Anyone entering has to fight through them or retreat. Costs **₡5 per fighter per day** in maintenance—if you can't pay, they're auto-destroyed.

**Mines:**
Deploy mines in sectors (₡10,000 each). When enemies warp in:
- 20-90% chance each mine explodes
- 75-225 damage per mine
- **Your corporation members are SAFE** from your mines

**Beacons:**
₡500 each. Plant them in sectors with a message (255 chars). Every ship that enters sees your message broadcast. Great for:
- Territory warnings: *"This sector belongs to NovaCorp. Leave now."*
- Trap warnings: *"50 mines deployed. Your funeral."*
- Memes: *"You just lost the game."*

Enemies can attack your beacons (lose 0-5 fighters) to destroy them.

---

## 🌍 Part V: Planetary Empire

### Finding & Claiming Planets

About **3% of sectors** have unclaimed planets floating in the void. They're not on any map. You find them by exploring.

**How to Claim:**
1. Enter sector with planet
2. **CLAIM** button appears (free!)
3. Planet is now yours forever (until someone destroys it)

**Planet Names:**
The galaxy's full of colonies with names like "Alpha Prime," "Nexus Outpost," "Vega Colony." Your ship computer assigns a random name. Live with it or role-play harder.

### Colonization: The Long Game

**Phase 1: Transport Colonists**
- Buy colonists at ports (₡100 each, max 1000/transaction)
- Fly to your planet
- **Deposit colonists** (they live there now)

**Phase 2: Set Production Type**
Choose what your planet produces:
- **Fuel Production**: 50 fuel + 10 org + 10 equip per 1000 colonists/hour
- **Organics Production**: 10 fuel + 50 org + 10 equip per 1000 colonists/hour
- **Equipment Production**: 10 fuel + 10 org + 50 equip per 1000 colonists/hour
- **Balanced**: 25 of each (safe but inefficient)

**Phase 3: Build Citadel**
Citadels defend your planet AND boost production:

| Level | Cost | Defense | Production Bonus |
|-------|------|---------|------------------|
| 0 | Free | Colonist militia only | +0% |
| 1 | ₡50,000 | Basic Quasar Cannon | +10% |
| 2 | ₡150,000 | Enhanced Shields | +20% |
| 3 | ₡400,000 | Atmospheric Defense | +30% |
| 4 | ₡900,000 | Transporter Beam | +40% |
| 5 | ₡1,900,000 | Interdictor Generator | +50% |

**Phase 4: Profit**
- Visit planet periodically
- **Withdraw resources** (fuel/org/equip)
- Sell at ports
- **ROI: ~1 day** with 10K colonists + Level 5 citadel

**Example Profit Calculation:**
- 10,000 colonists on Equipment planet with Level 5 citadel
- Production: 50 equip/hour × 1.5 (citadel bonus) = 75 equip/hour
- 24 hours = 1,800 equipment
- Sell at BBS port (₡94/unit) = **₡169,200 per day**
- Citadel cost (₡1.9M) paid off in 11 days

### Genesis Torpedoes: Create Your Own Planets

Can't find a planet? **Make one.**

**Genesis Torpedo Mechanics:**
- Buy at StarDock: **₡50,000 each**
- Carry capacity varies by ship (Scout: 5, Corporate Flagship: 25)
- Launch in any sector (costs 1 turn)
- **Restrictions:** Can't launch in TerraSpace (1-10), port sectors, or sectors with existing planets
- Creates unclaimed planet with random name
- **TNN Broadcast**: Entire universe is notified of your planet creation

**Strategic Uses:**
- Create planets in remote sectors (harder for pirates to find)
- Create planets near your corporation's territory
- Create planets as trade hubs between port clusters

---

## 🏦 Part VI: Banking & Finance

### StarDock Banking System

TerraCorp's **StarDock Banking System** lets you store credits safely. Safer than carrying cash, anyway.

**Banking Basics:**
- **Personal Account** - Your private vault (auto-created)
- **Corporate Account** - Shared with your corporation
- **Deposit**: Free, unlimited
- **Withdraw**: **5% fee** (₡5 per ₡100 withdrawn)
- **Transfer**: Free, send to any player

**Death Penalty:**
- Lose **25% of bank balance** when killed
- Your attacker doesn't get this—it just vanishes (TerraCorp insurance fraud)

**Why Use Banking?**
- Keep credits safe from pirates (they only loot on-hand credits at 75% rate)
- Fund corporation operations (shared corporate account)
- Transfer credits to allies

**Why NOT Use Banking?**
- 5% withdrawal fee hurts
- 25% bank balance lost on death
- If you're confident you won't die, carry credits on-hand

### Corporate Banking Permissions

| Rank | Deposit | Withdraw Limit |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Founder** | ✅ Unlimited | ✅ Unlimited |
| **Officer** | ✅ Unlimited | ⚠️ ₡100,000 max per transaction |
| **Member** | ✅ Unlimited | ⚠️ ₡10,000 max per transaction |

Trust your officers. Or don't.

## 🛸 Part VII: The Alien Question

### They Came Back

In 2028, long-range scanners picked up energy signatures that didn't match any known technology. At first, TerraCorp dismissed them as sensor ghosts. Then a supply convoy disappeared near the Outer Rim. Then another. Then an entire mining colony went dark.

They're not ghosts. They're **aliens**—species that humanity thought were myths or extinct. And they're back with a vengeance.

### The Alien Races

Ten distinct species, each with their own ships, behaviors, and apparent motives:

**Known Species:**
- **Xenthi** - Crystalline bio-ships, mostly neutral traders
- **Vorlak** - Aggressive warships, attack on sight
- **Krynn** - Defensive, guard their territory fiercely
- **Sslith** - Patrol routes, avoid confrontation
- **Zendarr** - Unknown motives, erratic behavior
- **Thorax**, **Quell**, **Nebari**, **Vedran**, **Pyrians** - Still under observation

### Alien Encounters

**Alien Ships:**
- Found in sectors, marked with race name and ship type
- Carry 65-90% of ship type's max fighters/shields
- Behaviors: **patrol**, **trade**, **aggressive**, **defensive**
- Aggressive aliens will attack you on sight
- Loot credits + cargo when destroyed

**Alien Planets:**
- ~3 per 1000 sectors (0.3% generation rate)
- Heavily defended (Citadel Level 3-4, 1,000-2,000 fighters, 50K-100K colonists)
- Attacking alien planets is **extremely dangerous**
- High-risk, high-reward targets for endgame players

### The Alien Communications Network

When you first enter a sector with an **alien planet**, your ship computer intercepts something—encrypted transmissions on frequencies humanity doesn't use. You shouldn't understand it. But your AI does.

**Alien Comms Channel:**
- **Read-only** - You can't send messages (they wouldn't listen anyway)
- **Auto-unlocks** when you visit an alien planet sector
- **Real-time intel** on alien activity:
  - Alien ship movements (30% chance to broadcast)
  - Combat between aliens and players
  - Alien ships destroyed by mines/fighters
  - Alien encounters with human ships

**Why Monitor Alien Comms?**
- Track aggressive alien movements
- Learn patrol patterns
- Avoid ambushes
- Find weakened targets

---

## 🏢 Part VIII: Corporations & Alliances

### The Corporation System

You started alone. One pilot, one ship, one corporation (yourself). That's... sad.

**Corporation Basics:**
- Everyone starts with their own personal corporation
- **Leave** your corp and join another (or create new one)
- **Invite** other players to join your corporation
- **Ranks**: Founder → Officer → Member

**Corporation Benefits:**
- **Corporate Chat Channel** - Private communication
- **Corporate Banking** - Shared funds
- **Territory Defense** - Your mines/fighters won't hurt corpmates
- **Reputation** - Strength in numbers

### Corporate Hierarchy

| Rank | Invite Players | Kick Members | Promote/Demote | Transfer Ownership | Leave Corp |
|------|----------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Founder** | ✅ | ✅ Anyone | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Must transfer first |
| **Officer** | ✅ | ✅ Members only | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Member** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

**Corporate Strategy:**
- Recruit traders to pool resources
- Recruit fighters to control territory
- Control port clusters with deployed fighters
- Share banking for emergency funds
- Coordinate attacks on high-value targets

---

## 🗺️ Part IX: Advanced Strategies

### Plot Course: The Smart Pilot's Tool

Your ship computer has a **pathfinding algorithm**. Use it.

**How It Works:**
1. Enter destination sector number
2. Computer calculates shortest path
3. **Auto-Navigation** - Automatically jumps through route
4. **Smart Pause** - Stops at ports, planets, StarDocks, other ships, aliens

**Why Use It:**
- Save time on long trips
- Avoid getting lost in deep space
- Auto-pauses at points of interest (you won't miss ports!)

**Turn Cost Warning:**
- Shows total turns needed
- Warns if you don't have enough turns
- Prevents you from getting stranded mid-journey

### Ship's Log: Your Memory

The galaxy is huge (1000+ sectors). You can't remember everything. Your **Ship's Log** does it for you.

**Auto-Logged Events:**
- **SOL** - Home sector (Sector 1)
- **PORT** - Trading ports (with port type)
- **STARDOCK** - Ship dealers
- **PLANET** - Planets (with names)
- **DEAD END** - Sectors with 0-1 exits (avoid unless hiding)

**Manual Notes:**
- Add notes to any sector
- Mark good trade routes
- Flag dangerous sectors
- Remember where you left that planet you claimed

**Filter Tabs:**
- All logs
- Ports only
- Planets only
- StarDocks only
- Dead Ends only
- Your notes only

### Deep Sector Scan

Don't want to waste a turn moving into an unknown sector? **Scan it first.**

**How It Works:**
- Costs **1 turn**
- Shows detailed info without moving:
  - Ships in sector (names, corps, ship types, fighters/shields)
  - Ports (type, buy/sell status)
  - Planets (name, owner)
  - Deployed fighters (owner, count)
  - Beacons (owner, encrypted message preview)
  - Floating cargo
  - Warps
  - Sector defenses (mines, hostile fighters)

**When to Use:**
- Scouting before combat
- Checking if trade route port is still there
- Avoiding ambushes
- Finding empty sectors to hide in

## 🎯 Part X: Ship Progression Guide

### The Fleet Hierarchy

| Ship | Cost | Holds | Fighters | Shields | Best For |
|------|------|-------|----------|---------|----------|
| **Escape Pod** | ₡0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | Dying |
| **Scout** | ₡10,000 | 20 | 10 | 10 | Exploration |
| **Trader** | ₡50,000 | 60 | 20 | 20 | Early trading |
| **Interceptor** | ₡75,000 | 30 | 40 | 30 | Fast combat |
| **Freighter** | ₡125,000 | 125 | 75 | 75 | Mid-game trading |
| **Transport** | ₡200,000 | 400 | 50 | 80 | Massive cargo runs |
| **Merchant Cruiser** | ₡250,000 | 250 | 150 | 150 | Balanced late-game |
| **Battlecruiser** | ₡350,000 | 100 | 200 | 200 | Pure combat |
| **Corporate Flagship** | ₡500,000 | 500 | 300 | 1000 | Endgame god mode |

### Ship Trade-In System

**Trade-in value: 70% of purchase price**

When you buy a new ship at StarDock:
- Your current ship is sold for **70% of original cost**
- Net cost = New ship price - Trade-in value
- **Fighters, shields, cargo transfer** to new ship (up to new ship's capacity)
- Excess is discarded (no refunds)

**Example:**
- You have a Trader (₡50,000)
- Trade-in value: ₡35,000
- Want a Freighter (₡125,000)
- **Net cost: ₡90,000**

### Progression Strategy

**Phase 1: Scout → Trader (₡40,000 net)**
- 20 turns of fuel trading (₡480/run) = ₡9,600
- 5 runs = ₡48,000 (enough for upgrade + buffer)

**Phase 2: Trader → Freighter (₡90,000 net)**
- 60-hold cargo runs (₡1,440/run)
- 63 runs = ₡90,720
- Or claim a planet and wait 1 day

**Phase 3: Freighter → Merchant Cruiser (₡162,500 net)**
- 125-hold cargo runs (₡3,000/run)
- 55 runs = ₡165,000
- Or planet passive income

**Phase 4: Merchant Cruiser → Corporate Flagship (₡325,000 net)**
- 250-hold cargo runs (₡6,000/run)
- 55 runs = ₡330,000
- Or multiple planets producing for days
- Or piracy (75% loot rate makes it profitable)

## ⚠️ Part XII: Survival Tips

### Things That Will Kill You

1. **Warp Misfires** - 0.25% chance. Can't prevent it. Just pray.
2. **Pirates** - Other players who want your cargo. Avoid populated sectors.
3. **Aggressive Aliens** - They attack on sight. Check Alien Comms before exploring.
4. **Deployed Fighters** - Enter sector, get option to retreat or fight. Choose wisely.
5. **Mines** - 20-90% explosion chance. If you see "⚠️ MINES DETECTED", run.
6. **Overconfidence** - Corporate Flagship isn't invincible. 10 players with Scouts will still wreck you.

### Things That Will Save You

1. **TerraSpace** - Sectors 1-10 are combat-free. Retreat here when wounded.
2. **Ship's Log** - Remember where safe routes are.
3. **Banking** - Keep most credits in bank (only lose 25% on death vs 75% on-hand loot).
4. **Corporation** - Allies won't trigger your mines/fighters. Numbers = safety.
5. **Plot Course** - Don't wander aimlessly. Plan your routes.
6. **Alien Comms** - Monitor alien movements. Avoid aggressive aliens.

### Etiquette & Unwritten Rules

- **Don't camp Sol** - Newbie hunting is pathetic
- **Honor ransoms** - If someone pays, let them go
- **Don't spam Corporate Chat** - Your corpmates will kick you
- **Respect beacons** - If a sector is claimed, maybe don't mine it
- **TNN is public** - Don't whine about deaths in broadcast messages

---

## 🌌 Part XIII: The Endgame

### What Victory Looks Like

There's no "win condition" in TradeWars 2030. No credits high score that ends the game. No final boss. Just you, your ship, and the void.

**But here's what the best pilots achieve:**

**Economic Victory:**
- Corporate Flagship ship
- 10+ colonized planets producing 24/7
- Millions in credits across personal + corporate bank
- Control of multiple SSS/BBB rare ports via territory defense

**Military Victory:**
- 100+ kills in combat log
- Feared corporation name that makes pilots flee on sight
- Control of strategic sectors with layered mine/fighter defenses
- Successful alien planet raids

**Exploration Victory:**
- 90%+ of universe mapped in Ship's Log
- All alien planets discovered and logged
- Every StarDock located and cataloged
- Deep-space routes that bypass main shipping lanes

**Political Victory:**
- 50+ member corporation
- Alliance network spanning multiple corps
- Corporate banking used to fund universe-wide operations
- Diplomatic immunity through sheer economic power

### The Final Transmission

TerraCorp will never acknowledge your success. There are no medals for space traders. No awards ceremonies in the void.

But every pilot knows the legends. The names whispered in Corporate Chat. The beacons that warn of empires built on guts and credits.

**You started with a Scout and a dream.**

**Now go build something that scares the megacorps.**
